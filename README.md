This Content Management System was done as an individual project before commencing my studies in the Computer Science and & Engineering department. I wanted to be familiarized with some web development technologies and therefore to learn and grow my skills, I thought of doing an individual project rather than following only the theory parts.

The system provides users the ability to
- upload blog posts about popular computer science courses which they have followed, under different categories.
- comment on blog posts
 
The system admins can
- approve blog posts and comments
- decline blog posts and comments,
- create/update/delete users
- create/update/delete categories so that unapproved posts and comments wonâ€™t be visible to the public.

Technologies used: PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL
